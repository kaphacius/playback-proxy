> A proxy tool that records communication (requests, websockets) between client and server. This recording can later be used for tests as a mock backend. It works in 2 modes, **RECORD** and **PLAYBACK**, capturing and reproducing the server responses respectively. 

## Supported Features
- Record multiple calls to the same endpoint. These will be reproduced in the same order during **PLAYBACK** as they were requested.
- Record web socket events. These will be reproduced based on the last request and time before socket was received. This means that if the socket was received 2 seconds after a particular call in **RECORD** mode, during **PLAYBACK** it will be sent 2 seconds after that particular call is requested.
- Specify a list of endpoints that are recorded only once. Same response will be used during **PLAYBACK** for every call. See _SAVE_SINGLE_ parameter in the `.env` file 
- Specify a list of endpoints that are not printed to the log. See _IGNORE_LOG_ parameter in the `.env` file

## Unsupported (yet) Features
- Saving responses in any other format (json, plaintext) than binary
- Using `https` and `wss` protocols
- Any other ideas people might have
